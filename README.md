This is the code for an exploratory analysis of language similarities between constitutions. 

Dependencies:
Numpy
Scipy
Nltk
Scikit-learn

TODO:
- Get top used words √
- Implement data clustering √
- Refactor dataset into class √
- add judicial freedom √
- add state stability √
- add clustering trials + aggregation √
- do regression
- add some confounders
- build topwords/clusters table √
- build desc stat/clusters table √
- build country/cluster table

TEXT:
- Bag of words disregards order and grammar, use better methods...
- We are using ML for a different purpose than what it is usually for, thus we don't do the same things..
- Research relations between cluster membership as dependent vars and exogenous variables...
- This analysis focuses more on the form rather than the contents of a constitution...
- Analysis is cross-section, time series could help
- k-means is weak, use better algorithms
- add distance measure
- should take means of different runs
- could do supervised learning using constitution characteristics or dep. variables as labels.
