a.life, liberty, security of the person and the protection of the law;

b.freedom of conscience, of expression and of assembly and association; and

c.protection for the privacy of his home and other property and from deprivation of property without compensation,




the provisions of this Chapter shall have effect for the purpose of affording protection to those rights and freedoms subject to such limitations of that protection as are contained in those provisions, being limitations designed to ensure that the enjoyment of the said rights and freedoms by any person does not prejudice the rights and freedoms of others or the public interest.



2. Protection of right to life
Share


1. No person shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in execution of the sentence of a court in respect of a criminal offence under any law of which he has been convicted.

a.for the defence of any person from violence or for the defence of property;

b.in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent the escape of a person lawfully detained;

c.for the purpose of suppressing a riot, insurrection or mutiny; or

d.in order to prevent the commission by that person of a criminal offence,

h.in the case of a person who is, or is reasonably suspected to be, of unsound mind, addicted to drugs or alcohol, or a vagrant, for the purpose of his care or treatment or the protection of the community;

i.for the purpose of preventing the unlawful entry of that person into Saint Vincent, or for the purpose of effecting the expulsion, extradition or other lawful removal of that person from Saint Vincent or for the purpose of restricting that person while he is being conveyed through Saint Vincent in the course of his extradition or removal as a convicted prisoner from one country to another; or

j.to such extent as may be necessary in the execution of a lawful order requiring that person to remain within a specified area within Saint Vincent, or prohibiting him from being within such an area, or to such extent as may be reasonably justifiable for the taking of proceedings against that person with a view to the making of any such order or relating to such an order after it has been made, or to such extent as may be reasonably justifiable for restraining that person during any visit that he is permitted to make to any part of Saint Vincent in which, in consequence of any such order, his presence would otherwise be unlawful.






2. Any person who is arrested or detained shall with reasonable promptitude and in any case no later than twenty-four hours after such arrest or detention be informed in a language that he understands of the reasons for his arrest or detention and be afforded reasonable facilities for private communication and consultation with a legal practitioner of his own choice and, in the case of a minor, with his parents or guardian.

4. Where any person is brought before a court in execution of the order of a court in any proceedings or upon suspicion of his having committed or being about to commit an offence, he shall not be thereafter further held in custody in connection with those proceedings or that offence save upon the order of a court.




5. If any person arrested or detained as mentioned in subsection (3)(b) of this section is not tried within a reasonable time, without prejudice to any further proceedings that may be brought against him, he shall be released either unconditionally or upon reasonable conditions, including in particular such conditions as are reasonably necessary to ensure that he appears at a later date for trial or for proceedings preliminary to trial.




6. Any person who is unlawfully arrested or detained by any other person shall be entitled to compensation therefore from that other person or from any other person or authority on whose behalf that other person was acting:


Provided that a judge, a magistrate or a justice of the peace or an officer of a court or a police officer acting in pursuance of the order of a judge, a magistrate or a justice of the peace shall not be under any personal liability to pay compensation under this subsection in consequence of any act performed by him in good faith in the discharge of the functions of his office and any liability to pay any such compensation in consequence of any such act shall be a liability of the Crown.

Any provision in this Constitution that vests in any person or authority the power to remove any public officer from his office shall be without prejudice to the power of any person or authority to abolish any office or to any law providing for the compulsory retirement of public officers generally or any class of public officer on attaining an age specified by or under that law.




10. Where this Constitution vests in any person or authority the power to appoint any person to act in or to exercise the functions of any office if the holder thereof is himself unable to exercise those functions, no such appointment shall be called in question on the grounds that the holder of the office was not unable to exercise those functions.




11. No provision of this Constitution that any person or authority shall not be subject to the direction or control of any other person or authority in the exercise of any functions under this Constitution shall be construed as precluding a court of law from exercising jurisdiction in relation to any question whether that person or authority has exercised those functions in accordance with this Constitution or any other law.




12. Without prejudice to the provisions of section 14 of the Interpretation Act 1978 [FN: 1978 c. 30.] (as applied by subsection (15) of this section), where any power is conferred by this Constitution to make any order, regulation or rule or give any direction or make any designation, the power shall be construed as including the power, exercisable in like manner and subject to the like conditions, if any, to amend or revoke any such order, regulation, rule, direction, or designation.




13. Save as may be otherwise provided by Parliament, the provisions (except sections 2 and 16) of the Commissions of Enquiry Ordinance of Saint Vincent shall apply, with the necessary adaptations, in relation to tribunals appointed under sections 32(6), 77(7), 81(8), 82(8) and 86(6) of this Constitution or, as the context may require, to the members thereof as they apply in relation to Commissions or Commissioners appointed under that Ordinance.
