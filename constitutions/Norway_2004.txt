The Kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible and inalienable Realm. Its form of government is a limited and hereditary monarchy.



Article 2
Share

All inhabitants of the Realm shall have the right to free exercise of their religion.


The Evangelical-Lutheran religion shall remain the official religion of the State. The inhabitants professing it are bound to bring up their children in the same [manner].

Share

Article 3
Share

The Executive Power is vested in the King, or in the Queen if she has succeeded to the Crown pursuant to the provisions of Article 6 or Article 7 or Article 48 of this Constitution. When the Executive Power is thus vested in the Queen, she has all the rights and obligations which, pursuant to this Constitution and the Law of the Land, are possessed by the King.



Article 4
Share

The King shall, at all times, profess the Evangelical-Lutheran religion, and uphold and protect the same.



Article 5
Share

The King’s person is sacred; he cannot be censured or accused. The responsibility rests with his Council.



Article 6
Share

The order of succession is lineal, so that only a child born in lawful wedlock of the Queen or King, or of one who is herself or himself entitled to the succession may succeed, and so that the nearest line shall take precedence over the more remote and the elder in the line over the younger.


An unborn child shall also be included among those entitled to the succession and shall immediately take her or his proper place in the line of succession as soon as she or he is born into the world.


The right of succession shall not, however, belong to any person who is not born in the direct line of descent from the last reigning Queen or King or a sister or brother thereof, or is herself or himself a sister or brother thereof.


When a Princess or Prince entitled to succeed to the Crown of Norway is born, her or his name and time of birth shall be notified to the first Storting (Stortinget) in session and be entered in the record of its proceedings.


For those born before the year 1971, Article 6 of the Constitution as it was passed on November 18, 1905 shall, however, apply. For those born before the year 1990, it shall nevertheless be the case that a male shall take precedence over a female.



Article 7
Share

If there is no Princess or Prince entitled to the succession, the King may propose his successor to the Storting, which has the right to make the choice if the King’s proposal is not accepted.



Article 8

The age of majority of the King shall be laid down by law.


As soon as the King has attained the age prescribed by law, he shall make a public declaration that he is of-age.

“I promise and swear that I will govern the Kingdom of Norway in accordance with its Constitution and Laws; so help me God, the Almighty and Omniscient.”

The King himself chooses a Council from among Norwegian citizens who are entitled to vote. This Council shall consist of a Prime Minister and at least seven (7) other Members.


More than half (1/2) the number of the Members of the Council of State shall profess the official religion of the State.

Husband and wife, parent and child or two siblings may never sit at the same time in the Council of State.



Article 13
Share

During his travels within the Realm, the King may delegate the administration of the Realm to the Council of State.

It shall scrupulously observe the provisions of this Constitution, as well as such particular directives in conformity therewith as the King may instruct.


The matters of business shall be decided by voting, where in the event of the votes being equal, the Prime Minister, or in his absence the highest-ranking Member of the Council of State who is present, shall have two (2) votes.

Share

The King may issue and repeal ordinances relating to commerce, customs tariffs, all economic sectors and the police; although these must not conflict with the Constitution or with the laws passed by the Storting (as hereinafter prescribed in Articles 77, 78 and 79). They shall remain in force provisionally until the next Storting.

Share

The King shall choose and appoint, after consultation with his Council of State, all senior civil, ecclesiastical and military officials. Before the appointment is made, such officials shall swear or, if by law exempted from taking the oath, solemnly declare obedience and allegiance to the Constitution and the King, although senior officials who are not Norwegian nationals may by law be exempted from this duty. The Royal Princes must not hold senior civil offices.

Whether pensions should be granted to senior officials thus dismissed shall be determined by the next Storting. In the interval they shall receive two-thirds (2/3) of their previous pay.


Other senior officials may only be suspended by the King, and must then without delay be charged before the Courts, but they may not, except by court judgment, be dismissed nor, against their will, transferred.


All senior officials may, without a prior court judgment, be discharged from office upon attaining the statutory age limit.



Article 23
Share

The King may bestow orders upon whomever he pleases, as a reward for distinguished services, and such orders must be publicly announced, but no rank or title other than that attached to any office. The order exempts no one from the common duties and burdens of citizens, nor does it carry with it any preferential admission to senior official posts in the State. Senior officials honorably discharged from office retain the title and rank of their office. This does not apply, however, to Members of the Council of State or the State Secretaries.


No personal, or mixed, hereditary privileges may henceforth be granted to anyone.

If so many Members are lawfully prevented from attending that not more than half (1/2) of the stipulated number are present, the requisite number of other men or women shall be temporarily appointed to take a seat in the Council of State.



Article 30
Share

All the proceedings of the Council of State shall be entered in its records. Diplomatic matters which the Council of State decides to keep secret shall be entered in a special record. The same applies to military command matters which the Council of State decides to keep secret.


Everyone who has a seat in the Council of State has the duty frankly to express his opinion, to which the King is bound to listen. But, it rests with the King to make a decision according to his own judgment.


If any Member of the Council of State is of the opinion that the King’s decision conflicts with the form of government or the laws of the Realm, or is clearly prejudicial to the Realm, it is his duty to make strong remonstrances against it, as well as to have his opinion entered in the records. A member who has not thus protested is deemed to have been in agreement with the King, and shall be answerable in such manner as may be subsequently decided, and may be impeached by the Odelsting before the Court of Impeachment.



Article 31
Share

All decisions drawn up by the King shall, in order to become valid, be countersigned.

Rules may be laid down by law concerning the right to vote of persons, otherwise entitled to vote, who on Election Day are manifestly suffering from a serious mental weakness or a reduced level of consciousness.

Article 57
Share

The number of representatives to be elected to the Storting shall be one hundred and sixty-nine (169).


The Realm is divided into nineteen (19) constituencies.


One hundred and fifty of the Representatives of the Storting are elected as representatives of the constituencies while the remaining nineteen representatives are elected in order to achieve a greater degree of proportionality.


Each constituency shall have one of these additional seats.


The number of representatives to the Storting to be elected in each constituency is determined on the basis of a calculation of the relation between the number of inhabitants per area of each constituency and the number of inhabitants per area of the Realm as a whole, with every inhabitant counting as one point and every square kilometer counting as 1.8. The calculations have to be updated every eighth year.


Detailed rules on the division of the Realm into constituencies and the distribution of seats in the Storting between the constituencies will be determined by law.



Article 58
Share

The polls shall be held separately for each municipality. At the polls, votes shall be cast directly for representatives to the Storting, together with their proxies, to represent the entire constituency.



Article 59
Share

The election of representatives of constituencies is based on proportional representation and the seats are distributed among the political parties in accordance with the following rules.


The total number of votes cast for each party within each separate constituency is divided by 1.4, 3, 5, 7 and so on until the number of votes cast is divided as many times as the number of seats that the party in question may expect to obtain. The party which, in accordance with the foregoing, obtains the largest quotient is allotted the first seat, while the second seat is allotted to the party with the second largest quotient, and so on until all the seats are distributed.


List alliances are not permitted.


The additional [19] seats are distributed among the parties taking part in such distribution on the basis of the relation between the total numbers of votes cast for the individual parties in the entire Realm in order to achieve the highest possible degree of proportionality among the parties. The total number of seats of each party in the Storting is determined by applying the rules on the distribution of constituency seats correspondingly to the entire Realm and to the parties taking part in the distribution of the additional seats. The parties are then allotted so many additional seats that these, together with the constituency seats already allotted, correspond to the number of seats in the Storting to which the party in question is entitled in accordance with the foregoing. If, through the distribution of constituency seats, a party has already obtained a greater number of seats than that to which it is entitled in accordance with the foregoing, a new distribution of the additional seats shall be carried out exclusively among the other parties, in such a way that no account is taken of the number of votes cast for and constituency seats obtained by the said party.


No party may be allotted an additional seat unless it has received at least four percent (4%) of the total number of votes cast in the entire Realm.


Detailed rules on the distribution of additional party seats in the constituencies will be determined by law.

Nor may State Secretaries as long as they hold their appointments and political advisers in government departments as long as they occupy their position attend as representatives.

If the Bill is passed, it is sent to the Lagting, which either approves or rejects it, and in the latter case returns it with appended comments. These are taken into consideration by the Odelsting, which either shelves the bill or again sends it to the Lagting, with or without alteration.

Each party in the proceedings  may challenge an equal number of the Members of the Lagting, although the accused has the preferential right to challenge one (1) more, if the number to be challenged is not divisible by two (2). The same shall apply to the challenging of the Members of the Supreme Court.

The President of the Court of Impeachment and the President of the Supreme Court shall in no case retire following the drawing of lots.


If the Court of Impeachment cannot be composed of as many Members of the Lagting or of the Supreme Court as prescribed above, the case may nevertheless be tried and judgment rendered, provided that the Court numbers at least ten (10) judges.


Specific provisions as to the procedure to be followed in the composition of the Court of Impeachment shall be laid down by law.
