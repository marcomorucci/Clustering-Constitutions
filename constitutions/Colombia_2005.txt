In the elections of candidates, ballot cards, which are numbered and printed on a paper offering sufficient security guarantees, will be used and will be distributed officially.

Article 263-A
Share

The distribution of seats between the members of the respective public body will be made by application of the system of the distributing number. This number is obtained by dividing successively by one, two, three, or more the number of votes received by each list and placing the results in a descending order until the total number of results obtained corresponds to the number of seats to be filled.


The lowest resulting number is called the distributing number (cifra repartidora). Each list will obtain the number of seats that corresponds to the number of times the distributing number is contained in the total number of its votes.


Each political party or movement may choose the system of preferential vote. In this case the voter may mark the candidate of his/her preference from the list of names shown on the ballot card. The list will be reorganized according to the number of votes obtained by each candidate. The distribution of seats will take place in descending order, beginning with the candidate who obtained the highest number of preferential votes.


In the case of the political parties and movements that have chosen the system of preferential vote, the votes for the party or movement that have not been given by the voter to any candidate in particular will be counted for the respective list for the purpose of the application of the laws concerning the threshold and the distributing number, but they will not be counted for the reorganization of the list.
