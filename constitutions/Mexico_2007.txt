Share

Article 1
Share

Every individual in the United Mexican States shall enjoy the guarantees granted by this Constitution, which cannot be restricted or suspended except in such cases and under such conditions as herein provided.


Slavery is forbidden in the United Mexican States. Slaves who enter the national territory from abroad shall, by this act alone, obtain their freedom and enjoy the protection afforded by the laws.


All discrimination motivated by ethnic or national origin, gender, age, handicaps, social condition, health, religion, opinions, preferences, marital status, or any other discrimination that violates human dignity and has the objective of restricting or diminishing the rights and liberties of persons is prohibited.



Article 2
Share

The Mexican Nation is one (Ãºnica) and indivisible.


The Nation has a multicultural composition which has its roots in its indigenous peoples, comprising those who have descended from the people who inhabited the present territory of the country at the beginning of the colonization and who have preserved at least partially their own social, economic, cultural, and political institutions.


The awareness of their indigenous identity shall be an essential criterion in determining to whom the provisions on indigenous peoples apply.


Communities of indigenous people are those which constitute a social, economic, and cultural unit, are situated in a territory, and have their own authorities in accordance with their traditions and customs.


The right of indigenous peoples to self-determination shall be exercised within a constitutional framework of autonomy that ensures national unity. The indigenous peoples and communities shall be recognized in the constitutions and laws of the federal entities, which shall take into consideration, in addition to the general principles established in the previous paragraphs of this article, ethno-linguistic criteria and physical location.



A. This Constitution recognizes and guarantees the right of indigenous peoples and communities to self-determination and, as a result, their autonomy with regard to:

I.Deciding their forms of group life and internal social, economic, political, and cultural organization.

II.Applying their own systems of rules in the regulation and resolution of their internal conflicts, so long as these are consistent with the general principles of this Constitution, respecting the guarantees of the individual, human rights, and in particular the dignity and integrity of women. The law will establish the mechanisms and procedures of enforcement by the appropriate judges or courts.

III.Electing in accordance with their traditional customs, procedures, and practices, the authorities or representatives charged with the exercise of self-government, guaranteeing the participation of women in conditions of equality with men and within a framework that respects the federal pact and the sovereignty of the States.

IV.Preserving and developing their languages, knowledge, and all the elements that constitute their culture and identity.

V.Protecting and improving their living environment and preserving the integrity of their territories in accordance with the terms established by this Constitution.

VI.Having access to the preferential use of natural resources in the territories that these communities occupy and in which they live, except for those that correspond to strategic areas as determined by this Constitution, while respecting the forms and categories of property and land usage established by this Constitution and the relevant laws as well as any rights acquired by third parties or by members of the community. To this end Communities may merge with others in the terms provided for by the law.

VII.Electing, in municipalities with an indigenous population, representatives to the municipal governments.

The constitutions and laws of the federal entities shall recognize and regulate these rights in the municipalities with the objective of strengthening participation and political representation in a manner consistent with their traditions and internal rules.

VIII.Having full access to the court system of the State. In order to guarantee this right in all trials and proceedings in which they take part, individually or collectively, their customs and cultural particularities shall be taken into account, while respecting the principles of this Constitution. Indigenous people have at all times the right to be assisted by translators and counsel who know their language and culture.

The constitutions and laws of the federal entities shall establish the characteristic elements of self-determination and autonomy which best correspond to the circumstances and aspirations of the indigenous people in each entity, as well as the rules on the recognition of the indigenous communities as entities of public interest.






B. In order to promote equal opportunity for the indigenous people and to eliminate any discriminatory practices, the Federation, states, and municipalities, shall establish the institutions and determine the policies required to guarantee the effectiveness of the rights of the indigenous population and the comprehensive development of their peoples and communities. They shall be conceived and applied in coordination with them.


In order to address the hardship and lack of development that affect the indigenous peoples and communities, these authorities have the obligation to:

I.Stimulate the regional development of indigenous zones, with the objective of strengthening the local economies and enhancing the quality of life of their peoples, through coordinated actions of the three branches of government and with the participation of the communities. The Municipal authorities shall equitably determine budget allocations that the communities will administer directly and for specific ends.

II.Guarantee and increase the levels of schooling, favoring bilingual and inter-cultural education, literacy, completion of basic education, vocational training, and middle and higher education. Establish a scholarship program for indigenous students at all levels. Define and develop educational programs of regional content that recognize the cultural heritage of their peoples, in accordance with the relevant laws and in consultation with the indigenous communities. Stimulate respect and knowledge of the diverse cultures that exist in the Nation.

III.Ensure effective access to health care services by expanding the coverage of the national system, making good use of traditional medicine, and support the nutrition of indigenous people through food programs, especially for the child population.

IV.Improve the conditions of indigenous communities as well as their living and recreational areas through initiatives that facilitate access to public and private financing of construction and improvement of housing, as well as the expansion of the coverage of basic social services.

V.Promote the incorporation of indigenous women into the development of the community by providing support for productive projects, the protection of their health, and stimulate their access to education and participation in the decision-making processes related to community life.

VI.Expand the network of communications so as to permit the integration of the communities through the construction and expansion of channels of communication and telecommunication. Establish conditions under which indigenous peoples and communities may acquire, operate, and administer means of communication, in the terms defined by the relevant laws.

VII.Support productive activities and sustainable development of indigenous communities through initiatives that permit them to generate sufficient income, the creation of incentives for public and private investments that encourage the creation of jobs, and the use of technology in order to increase their productive capacity as well as to ensure equitable access to the supply and trade systems.

VIII.Establish social policies to protect indigenous migrants, within both national and foreign territory, through actions to guarantee the labor rights of agricultural day workers, improve the health conditions of women, support children and young people from migrant families through special education and nutrition programs, monitor the respect for their rights and disseminate information about their culture.

IX.Consult with indigenous peoples in the elaboration of the National Development Plan and the development plans of states and municipalities and incorporate their recommendations and proposals, as appropriate.




In order to guarantee the fulfillment of the obligations established in this paragraph, the Chamber of Deputies of the Congress of the Union, the legislatures of the federal entities, and the municipal councils shall include, in the ambit of their respective competences, the funding allocations specifically earmarked for the fulfillment of these obligations in their approved spending budgets, as well as the methods and procedures available for [indigenous] communities to participate in their implementation and control.


Without prejudice to the rights established herein in favor of the indigenous people, their communities and their towns, all communities which are comparable to them shall have the same rights, as established by the law.




Article 3
Share

Every individual has the right to receive an education. The State--the Federation, the States, the Federal District and the municipalities--shall provide pre-school, primary, and secondary education. Pre-school, primary and secondary education constitutes the basic compulsory education.


The education imparted by the State shall be designed to harmoniously develop all the faculties of the human being and shall foster in him, at the same time, the love of the fatherland and a consciousness of international solidarity in independence and justice.

I.As Article 24 guarantees freedom of beliefs, education shall be secular (laica) and, as such, must be maintained entirely apart from any religious doctrine.

II.The guiding criterion for such education shall be based on the results of scientific progress and shall strive against ignorance and its effects, servitudes, fanaticism, and prejudice.

Moreover:

a.It shall be democratic, considering democracy not only a judicial structure and a political arrangement but also a system of life based on the constant economic, social, and cultural improvement of the people;

b.It shall be national insofar as--without hostility or exclusiveness--it shall achieve the understanding of our problems, the utilization of our resources, the defense of our political independence, the assurance of our economic independence, and the continuity and growth of our culture; and

c.It shall contribute to better human relationships not only by the elements which it provides toward strengthening and at the same time inculcating, together with respect for the dignity of the person and the integrity of the family, the conviction of the general interest of society but also by the care which it devotes to the ideals of brotherhood and equality of rights of all men, avoiding privileges of race, religion, class, sex, or individuals;



III.In order to fully comply with the provisions in the second paragraph and in section II, the Federal Executive shall determine the initiatives and study programs for preschool, primary, secondary, and post-secondary education for the whole Republic. To that effect, the Federal Executive will take into consideration the views of the federal entities' governments and of the various social segments involved in the education field, consistent with the terms that the law specifies.

IV.All education provided by the State shall be free of charge.

V.Besides providing preschool, primary, and secondary education, as established in the first paragraph, the State shall promote and assist in all types and means of education--including primary and higher education--which are necessary for the development of the Nation, will support scientific and technological research, and will advance the strengthening and knowledge of our culture.

VI.Private persons may engage in education of all kinds and grades. Consistent with the terms established by law, the State grants and withdraws official recognition of studies performed in private facilities. In the case of preschool, primary, secondary, and post-secondary education, the criteria shall be:

a.To provide education following the same objectives and criteria established in the second paragraph and in section II, as well as to be in full compliance with the plans and programs referred to in section III, and

b.To obtain previously, in each case, express authorization from the public power, consistent with the terms established by law;



VII.Universities and other institutions of higher education that have been granted autonomy by law will have the ability and responsibility to govern themselves; will realize their objectives of education, research, and spreading culture consistent with the principles embodied in this article, respecting freedom of teaching and research and of free examination and discussion of ideas; will determine their initiatives and programs; will fix the terms related to salary, promotion, and tenure of their academic personnel; and will administer their own property. Labor relations concerning both academic and administrative personnel will be subject to section A of Article 123 of this Constitution and in conformity with the terms and requirements that the Federal Labor Law establishes with regard to the characteristics of a special work, in a manner that is consistent with the autonomy, freedom of teaching and research, and objectives of the institutions referred to in this section, and

VIII.The Congress of the Union, with the goal of unifying and coordinating education throughout the Republic, shall enact the necessary laws for dividing the social function of education among the Federation, the States, and the Municipalities, for setting the appropriate financial allocations for this public service and for establishing the sanctions applicable to officials who do not comply with or enforce the pertinent provisions as well as the penalties applicable to all those who infringe such provisions.

No person may be prevented from engaging in the profession, industrial or commercial pursuit, or occupation of his or her choice, so long as it is lawful. The exercise of this liberty may only be forbidden by a judicial determination when the rights of a third party are infringed or by a government resolution, issued in the manner provided by law, when the rights of society are undermined. No one may be deprived of the fruits of his or her labor except by judicial resolution.


The law in each state shall determine the professions that may be practiced only with a degree or license and set forth the requirements for obtaining such license and the authorities empowered to regulate them.

Article 7
Share

The freedom to write and publish writings on any subject is inviolable. No law or authority may establish prior censorship, require bonds from authors or printers, or restrict the freedom of printing, which shall be limited only by the respect due to private life, morals, and public peace. Under no circumstances may a printing press be seized as the instrument of a crime.


The organic laws shall contain whatever provisions are necessary to prevent the imprisonment of vendors, "newsboys," operators, and other employees of the establishment publishing the work denounced, under pretext of denunciation of offenses of the press, unless their guilt is previously established.

Article 9
Share

The right to assemble or associate peacefully for any lawful purpose shall not be restricted; but only citizens of the Republic may do so to take part in the political affairs of the country. No armed deliberative meeting or gathering is authorized.


No assembly or meeting which has as its object the petitioning of any authority or the presentation of a protest against any act shall be deemed unlawful; nor may it be dissolved, unless insults are proffered against the authority or violence is resorted to, or threats are made to intimidate or compel such authority to render the desired decision.



Article 10
Share

The inhabitants of the United Mexican States have the right to possess arms in their residences for their protection and legitimate defense, except such as are expressly forbidden by law or which have been reserved for the exclusive use of the Army, Navy, Air Force and National Guard.

Article 11
Share

Every person has the right to enter and leave the Republic, to travel through its territory, and to change his [or her] residence without the necessity of a letter of security, passport, safe conduct pass, or any other similar requirement. The exercise of this right shall be subordinated to the powers of the judiciary in cases of civil or criminal liability and to those of the administrative authorities insofar as concerns the limitations imposed by the laws regarding emigration, immigration, and public health of the country, or in regard to undesirable aliens resident in the country.



Article 12
Share

No titles of nobility, prerogatives or hereditary honors will be conferred in the United Mexican States, nor shall any recognition be given to those granted by other countries.



Article 13
Share

No one may be tried under laws designed only to apply to the case at hand (leyes privativas) or before special courts. No person or corporation can have privileges or enjoy emoluments other than those given in compensation for public services and which are set forth by law. Military jurisdiction is recognized for the trial of crimes against the violation of military discipline, but the military tribunals can in no case have jurisdiction over persons who do not belong to the armed forces. Whenever a civilian is implicated in a military crime or violation, the corresponding civil authority shall have jurisdiction over the case.



Article 14
Share

No law shall be given retroactive effect to the detriment of any person whatsoever.


No one may be deprived of liberty or his/her property, possessions or rights, except by means of a judicial proceeding before a duly created court in which the essential procedural formalities are observed and in accordance with the laws enacted prior to the act in question.


No penalty may be imposed in criminal cases by mere analogy or even by preponderance of the evidence unless such penalty is pronounced in the law and is in every respect applicable to the crime in question.


The final judgment in civil cases must conform to the letter or the judicial interpretation of the law, and, in the absence of the latter, such judgment shall be based on the general principles of law.



Article 15
Share

No treaty shall be authorized for the extradition of political offenders or of delinquents of the common order who have been slaves in the country where the offense was committed; nor shall any agreement or treaty be entered into which restricts or modifies the guarantees and rights established in this Constitution for man and citizen.



Article 16
Share

No one may be disturbed in his [or her] person, family, domicile, papers, or possessions, except by virtue of a written order by a competent authority stating the legal grounds and justification for the action taken.


No order of arrest or detention may be issued against any person other than by the competent judicial authority and unless it is preceded by a charge, accusation, or complaint for a specific action determined by the law to constitute a crime for which the accused may be punished by imprisonment and there is evidence to support both the punishment and the probable guilt of the accused.


The authority that carries out a judicial order of apprehension must take the accused before a judge without delay and under the strictest responsibility. Failure to do so is punishable under criminal law.


In cases of flagrante delicto, any person may detain the offender, turning him over without delay to the nearest authority, and from there, as expeditiously as possible, to the Public Ministry.


Only in urgent cases, when the offense constitutes a serious crime under the law and where there is well-founded risk that the accused may evade the action of justice and the accused cannot be brought before a judicial authority because of the time, place or circumstance, does the Public Ministry have the authority, on its strictest accountability, to order the accused person's detention founded on a thorough description of the evidence that motivated its decision.


In cases of urgency or flagrancy, the judge who receives the detained must immediately approve the detention or order liberty under the reservations of law.


No accused [person] may be detained by the Public Ministry for more than forty-eight (48) hours; within such period of time, the accused must either be set free or placed at the disposition of the judicial authority. This term may be doubled in those instances that are classified as organized crime under the law. All abuses of aforementioned provision will be subject to punishment under the criminal law.


Every search warrant, which can be issued only by a competent judicial authority and which must be in writing, shall specify the place to be searched, the person or persons to be detained, and the objects sought, and the proceedings shall be limited thereto. At the conclusion of the search warrant, a detailed statement shall be drawn up in the presence of two witnesses designated by the occupant of the place searched or, in his or her absence or refusal, by the official making the search.


Private communications are inviolable. The law shall criminally sanction any act that threatens the liberty and privacy of thereof. Only the federal judicial authority, upon petition by the federal official empowered by the law or the head of the Public Ministry of the corresponding federative entity, may authorize the interception of any private communication. To that effect, the proper authority must first establish and justify in writing the legal causes motivating the request and also indicate the type of interception, its subjects, and its duration. The federal judicial authority cannot authorize these interceptions when the communications involve electoral, fiscal, trade, civil, labor, or administrative matters, or in the case of private communications between a detained person and defender.


Authorized interceptions must conform to the requirements and limits specified in the laws. The product of any interceptions that do not comply with these requirements will lack all evidentiary value.


Administrative officials may enter private homes for the sole purpose of ascertaining whether the sanitary and police regulations have been complied with; and may demand to be shown the books and documents required to prove compliance with fiscal regulations, in which latter cases they must abide by the provisions of the respective laws and be subject to the formalities prescribed for searches.


Sealed correspondence sent through the mail is exempt from search, and any violation of this shall be punishable under the law.


No member of the armed forces may, in time of peace, be quartered in private dwellings without the consent of the owner, nor may he impose any obligation whatsoever. In times of war, the military may demand lodging, supplies, and other assistance, consistent with the terms established by the corresponding martial law.



Article 17
Share

No person may take the law into his or her own hands or resort to violence in the enforcement of his [or her] rights.


Every person has the right to have quick, complete and impartial justice by courts, which shall be open for the administration of justice at such times and under such conditions as established by law. The courts' services shall be gratuitous and all judicial costs are, therefore, prohibited.


Federal and local laws shall establish the methods necessary to guarantee the independence of the courts and the full execution of their decisions.


No one may be imprisoned for debts of a purely civil nature.



Article 18
Share

Preventive detention is permissible only for crimes punishable by imprisonment. The place of such detention shall be distinct and completely separate from the place used for the serving of sentences.


The federal and state governments shall organize the penal system within their respective jurisdictions on the basis of labor, training, and education as means of social readjustment of the offender. Women shall serve their sentences in places separate from those designated for men for the same purpose.


State governors may, subject to the provisions of their respective local laws, conclude agreements of a general nature with the federal government, under which offenders convicted for  common crimes may serve their sentences in establishments maintained by the Federal Executive.


The Federation, the States and the Federal District shall establish; within their respective powers, an integrated system of justice which shall apply to those who are at least twelve and less than eighteen years old and have shown a conduct which the penal laws qualify as crime, a system which shall guarantee the fundamental rights of the individual recognized by this Constitution, as well as those special rights which they enjoy in their capacity of individuals still in the process of development. Persons of less than twelve years of age who have shown a conduct qualified as crime by the law shall only be subject to rehabilitation and social assistance.


The operation of the system in each province of government shall be the responsibility of institutions, courts and authorities specialized in the administration of justice for juveniles. The orientation, protection and other measures required by the specific case may be applied while taking into account the integral protection and the superior interest of the juvenile delinquent.


Alternative forms of justice must be given due consideration in the application of this system, insofar as they appear appropriate. In all proceedings brought against juvenile delinquents the guarantee of a fair trial shall be observed, as well as the principle of separation of the authorities competent to cancel the sanctions from those imposing them. They must be proportional to the conduct adopted and pursue the objective of social and family reintegration of the juvenile delinquent, as well as the full development of his/her personality and skills. The internment may only be used as ultimate sanction and for the shortest possible period, and may only be applied to juvenile delinquents of more than fourteen years of age for the adoption of antisocial behaviour which is qualified as grave.


Prisoners of Mexican nationality who are serving sentences in foreign countries may be transferred to the Republic to complete their sentences subject to the system of social readjustment previously described in this article, and prisoners of foreign nationality sentenced for federal crimes committed in the Republic or for common law offenses in the Federal District, may be transferred to their country of origin or residence, subject to the international treaties that may have been concluded to this effect. The governors of the States may solicit from the Federal Executive, consistent with their respective state laws, the inclusion of prisoners of the common order in these treaties. The transfer of prisoners may only be carried out with their express consent.


Prisoners, in the cases and under the conditions established by law, shall be allowed to serve their sentences in the penitentiary institutions located closest to their domicile so as to promote their reintegration to the community and their social readjustment.



Article 19
Share

No detention before a judicial authority may exceed the term of seventy-two (72) hours without a formal order of commitment, which shall state the crime for which the accused is charged; the place, time, and circumstances of its commission; and the facts resulting from the preliminary investigations, which must be sufficient to establish the corpus delicti and the probable guilt of the accused.


This period may be extended only at the petition of the accused, and as provided by law. Prolonging the detention otherwise will be punishable under criminal law.


The official responsible for the institution where the accused is detained, who does not receive an authorized copy of the formal order of commitment or of the written request to prolong it, must give notice of such occurrence to the judge who has jurisdiction in the case, and if [the official] does not receive the aforementioned documentation within the following three hours of the notification, [the official] shall free the accused.


The trial shall take place only for the crime or crimes set forth in the formal order of commitment. If it develops during the course of the proceedings that another crime, different from that originally charged, has been committed, a separate investigation must be conducted. This, however, shall not prevent the joinder of both proceedings if deemed advisable.


Any mistreatment during the time of arrest or confinement, any molestation lacking legal justification, and any duties or contributions levied in prison constitute abuses which shall be punishable by law and repressed by the authorities.



Article 20
Share

In every criminal trial, the accused, victim or the offended shall enjoy the following guarantees:

A.The accused:

I.He [or she] shall be provisionally freed on demand and immediately upon furnishing bail as determined by the judge except for crimes which, because of their gravity, the law expressly prohibits this benefit. In the case of non-serious crimes, upon request from the Public Ministry, the judge may deny bail in instances where the accused has been previously found guilty of a serious crime as classified by law. The judge may also deny bail when the Public Ministry introduces elements establishing that the accused represents, as evidenced by his or her previous conduct or by the circumstances and characteristics of the crime committed, a risk to the victim or to society in general.

The amount and form of bail shall be attainable by the accused. The judicial authority may modify the amount of bail in certain circumstances determined by law. In order to determine the form and the amount of bail, the judge must take into consideration the nature, means, and circumstances of the crime, the characteristics of the accused, and the probability that the accused will comply with his or her procedural obligations, the damages and injuries caused to the victim, as well as the financial penalty which may be imposed to the accused.

The serious cases for which the judge may deny bail shall be determined by law.

II.The accused may not be forced to confess. Keeping the accused incommunicado or subjecting him or her to any intimidation or torture is prohibited and punishable under the criminal law. Confessions given to any authority other than the Public Ministry or a judge, without the presence of his or her defender, will lack all evidentiary force whatsoever.

III.The accused shall be notified in a public hearing within forty-eight (48) hours after being turned over to the judicial authorities of the name of his or her accuser and the nature and cause of the accusation so that he or she may become familiar with the crime charged and reply thereto as part of his or her opening statement.

IV.When the accused so requires, he [or she] shall be confronted with the witnesses testifying against him [or her], and in the judge's presence, except as provided in subsection V of section B of this article.

V.All the witnesses and other evidence that the accused may offer in his [or her] defense shall be heard, and he [or she] shall be granted the necessary time as established by law for this purpose; the accused shall furthermore be assisted in securing the presence of the persons whose testimony he or she may request, provided they are to be found at the place where the trial is being conducted.

VI.The accused shall be entitled to a public trial by a judge or a jury of citizens who know how to read and write and are also residents of the place and district where the crime was committed, provided that the penalty for such crime exceeds one year's imprisonment. In all cases, crimes committed by means of the press against the public order or against the domestic or foreign security of the nation shall be subject to trial by jury.

VII.The accused shall be provided with all the information on record which he or she may require for his or her defense.

VIII.The accused shall be tried within four months if charged with a crime for which the maximum penalty does not exceed two years in prison, and within one year if the maximum penalty is greater unless he or she requests more time for his [or her] defense.

IX.At the beginning of the process, the accused shall be informed of his [or her] rights under this Constitution, and he [or she] shall have the right to an adequate defense, either personally, by counsel, or by a person of his [or her] trust. If the accused does not wish or is unable to name any counsel for his [or her] defense after being called upon to do so, the judge will appoint such counsel for the defense. The accused shall also be entitled to have his [or her] counsel present at every stage of the trial, and

X.In no event may imprisonment or detention be prolonged due to the accused person's failure to pay legal fees or for any other monetary obligation, on account of civil liability, or for other similar reason.

Nor shall detention be extended beyond the time established by law as the maximum for the crime charged.

The period of detention shall be deemed as part of the term of imprisonment imposed by sentence.

The aforementioned guarantees in sections I, V, VII, and IX shall also be observed during the initial investigation, consistent with the terms and the requirements and limits established by law; the provisions of section II will not be subject to any condition.



B.The victim or the offended:

I.Shall have access to legal counsel; be informed of his or her rights under this Constitution, and, when he [or she] so requests, be informed about the status of the criminal process.

II.Shall assist the Public Ministry and ensure that it is aware of all the facts or evidence about the crime that the victim has, both during the preliminary investigation as well as throughout the judicial process, and to relieve all the corresponding formalities.

When the Public Ministry is of the opinion that such relief of formalities is not necessary, it must substantiate and justify the reasoning behind its decision.

III.Receive, since the time the crime was committed, urgent medical and psychological care.

IV.Be compensated for all damages. In certain proper cases, the Public Ministry shall be compelled to seek compensation for the victim's damages, and the judge may not absolve the accused of the reparations if he or she has been convicted.

The law will establish an efficient procedure to enforce all rulings regarding the compensation of damages.

V.In cases of rape or kidnapping, when the victim or the offended is a minor, he [or she] shall not be required to face the accused. In such cases, depositions will be taken consistent with the conditions established by law, and

VI.Take all the necessary provisions available under the law to ensure the victim's security and to assist him or her as necessary.







Article 21
Share

The imposition of criminal penalties is an exclusive attribute of the judicial authority. The investigation and prosecution of crimes pertains to the Public Ministry and the judicial police which shall be under its immediate authority and command. The punishment of violations of governmental and police regulations, which shall be limited to a fine or arrest for a period not thirty-six hours, falls within the jurisdiction of the administrative authorities. If the offender fails to pay the fine imposed, it shall be commuted into the corresponding period of arrest, which shall in no case exceed thirty-six (36) hours.

Punishment by death, mutilation, infamy, branding, flogging, beating with sticks, torture of any kind, excessive fines, confiscation of property, and any other unusual or extreme penalties are prohibited.


Confiscation proceedings covering the whole or part of the property of a person by a judicial authority to cover payment of civil liability arising from the commission of a crime or for payment of taxes or fines shall not be considered a confiscation of property. Furthermore, a seizure, ordered by a judicial authority, of property acquired illegally as defined in Article 109, or the forfeiture of goods belonging to a person convicted of felonies classified as organized crime or goods which are depicted to be owned by the person sentenced, shall also not be deemed a confiscation of property unless the legitimate origin of these goods can be proven.

Goods confiscated as a result of an investigation or process and which were acquired through organized crime may be assigned to the State by the judicial authority at the termination of an investigation or process without the need for a specific pronouncement regarding the goods. The judicial decree (resoluciÃ³n) will always precede a hearing with the third parties involved in the case where it shall be fully established that the goods in question were acquired as a result of a felony classified by the law as organized crime, so long as it can be determined that the goods were the property or were in the possession of the accused.

Article 27
Share

Ownership of the lands and waters within the boundaries of the national territory is vested originally in the Nation, which has had, and continues to have, the right to transmit title thereof to private persons, thereby constituting private property.


Private property shall not be expropriated except for reasons of public use and subject to payment of indemnity.


The Nation shall at all times have the right to impose on private property such limitations as the public interest may demand, as well as the right to regulate the utilization of natural resources which are susceptible of appropriation, in order to ensure a more equitable distribution of public wealth, look after their conservation, achieve a more balanced development of the country and improvement of life for the rural and urban populations. Consequently, necessary measures shall be taken to organize human settlements and establish adequate provisions, uses, reserves, and end uses of lands, waters, and forests with the purpose of carrying out public works and planning and regulating their construction, conservation, improvement, and growth of centers of population; to preserve and restore ecological balance; to divide up large estates; to manage, consistent with the terms of the applicable regulations and law, the organization and collective functioning of common public lands and communities; to secure the development of small rural property; to encourage agriculture, ranching, forestry, and of the various economic activities in the rural setting, and to prevent the destruction of natural resources, and to protect property from damage to the detriment of society.


The Nation has direct ownership of all natural resources of the continental shelf and the submarine shelf of the islands; all minerals or substances that are in veins, layers, or masses; beds of ore that constitute deposits naturally distinct from the components of the earth itself, such as the minerals from which industrial metals and metalloids are derived; deposits of precious stones; rock salt, and the salt deposits formed by sea water; products derived from the decomposition of rocks when subterranean works are required for their extraction; mineral or organic deposits of materials susceptible of utilization as fertilizers; solid mineral fuels; petroleum and all solid, liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons; and the space above the national territory, to the extent and within the terms established by international law.


The waters of the territorial seas are the property of the Nation, within the limits and terms specified (que fije) by international law; inland marine waters; those of lagoons and estuaries permanently or intermittently connected with the sea; those of naturally-formed inland lakes which are directly connected with streams having a constant flow; those of rivers and their direct or indirect tributaries from the point in their source where their first permanent, intermittent or torrential waters begin to their mouth in the sea or a lake, lagoon, or estuary that are national property; those of constant or intermittently-running streams and creeks and their direct or indirect tributaries whenever the bed of the stream, throughout the whole or a part of its length, serves as a boundary of the national territory or between two federal entities, or if it flows from one federative entity to another or crosses the boundary line of the Republic; those of lakes, lagoons, or estuaries whose basins, zones, or shores are crossed by the boundary lines of two or more divisions or by the boundary line of the Republic and a neighboring country or when the shoreline serves as the boundary between two federal entities or of the Republic and a neighboring country; those of springs that originate from beaches, maritime zones, the beds, basins, or shores of lakes, lagoons, or estuaries in the national domain; and waters that are extracted from mines, and the channels, beds, or shores of inland lakes to the extent established by law. Underground waters may be brought to the surface by artificial works and utilized by the owner of the land, but if the public interest so requires or use by others is affected, the Federal Executive has the power to regulate its extraction and utilization and even to establish zones where underground water extraction is prohibited as may be done with all the other waters in the public domain. Any other waters not included in the foregoing list shall be considered an integral part of the property through which they flow on or in which they are deposited, unless they are located in two or more properties, in which case their utilization shall be deemed a matter of public use and shall be subject to the laws enacted by the States.


In the cases referred to in the preceding two paragraphs, ownership by the Nation is inalienable and imprescriptible, and the exploitation, use, or appropriation of these resources, by private individuals or by companies organized according to Mexican laws, may not be undertaken except through concessions granted by the Federal Executive in accordance with the rules and conditions established by law. The legal rules relating to the working or exploitation of the minerals and substances referred to in the fourth paragraph shall govern the execution and verification of what is carried out or should be carried out after they go into effect, independent of the date of granting the concessions, and their non-observance will be grounds for the cancellation of the concession. The Federal Government has the power (facultad) to establish national reserves and to abolish them. The declarations pertaining thereto shall be made by the Executive in those cases and conditions prescribed by law. No concessions or contracts shall be granted for the extraction of petroleum or solid, liquid, or gaseous hydrocarbons, or for radioactive minerals, nor may those that have been granted continue, and the Nation shall carry out the exploitation of these products, consistent with the provisions established in the respective regulatory law. Furthermore, the Nation has the exclusive right to generate, conduct, transform, distribute, and supply electric power to be used for public service. No concessions for this purpose will be granted to private individuals, and the Nation will make use of the property and natural resources required to achieve these ends.


The Nation also enjoys the use of nuclear combustibles for the generation of nuclear energy and to regulate its application for other uses or purposes. The use of nuclear energy is permitted only for peaceful purposes.


The Nation exercises control over an exclusive economic zone situated outside the territorial seas and adjacent to them, consistent with the rights of sovereignty and the jurisdictions established by the laws of Congress. The exclusive economic zone shall extend two hundred (200) nautical miles from where the territorial seas start. In those instances where this extension produces conflict with the exclusive economic zones of other countries, the boundaries of the respective zones shall be determined, as necessary, through agreements with those countries.


The legal capacity to acquire ownership of lands and waters of the Nation shall be governed by the following provisions:

I.Only Mexicans by birth or naturalization and Mexican companies have the right to acquire ownership of lands, waters, and their appurtenances (accesiones) or to obtain concessions for the exploitation of mines or waters. The State may grant the same right to foreigners, provided they agree before the Ministry of Foreign Relations to consider themselves nationals with respect to such property and bind themselves not to invoke the protection of their governments in matters relating thereto; under penalty, in case of noncompliance with the agreement, of forfeiture of the acquired property to the Nation. Under no circumstances may foreigners acquire direct ownership of lands or waters within a zone of one hundred (100) kilometers from the borders and of fifty (50) kilometers from the coasts of the country.

The State, in accordance with internal public interests and the principles of reciprocity and at the discretion of the Ministry of Foreign Relations, may authorize foreign States to acquire, at the permanent sites of the Federal Powers, private ownership of real property necessary for their direct services of their embassies or delegations.

II.Religious institutions, constituted in accordance with the terms of Article 130 and its regulating law, will have the capacity to exclusively acquire, possess, or administer the property that is essential to pursue their objectives, consistent with the requisites and limitations established by the applicable regulatory law.

III.Public or private charitable institutions established for the rendering of assistance to the needy, for scientific research, the dissemination of education, mutual aid to its members, or any other lawful purpose, may not acquire more real property that actually needed to fulfill their purpose and immediately and directly devoted thereto, subject to the provisions established by regulatory law.

IV.Commercial stock companies may acquire ownership of rural lands but only to the extent that is necessary to complete their objective.

In no case may companies of this type acquire lands dedicated to agriculture, ranching, or forestry activities in greater extension than the amount equivalent to twenty-five (25) times the limits established in section XV of this article. The regulatory law will determine the structure of capital and the minimum number of partners of these companies to ensure that the lands owned by the company do not exceed, in relation to each of its partners, the limits for small properties. In this case, all property of individual investors or partners consisting of rural lands will be counted for the effects of computation. Also, the law will provide the conditions for foreign participation in these companies.

The law will establish the means of registration and control necessary to implement this section.

V.Banks duly authorized to operate in accordance with the laws on credit institutions may hold capital obligations or mortgages on urban and rural property in conformity with the provisions of such laws, but they may not own or administer more real property than is actually necessary for their direct purpose.

VI.The States and the Federal District, as well as all the Municipalities in the Republic, shall have the full legal capacity to acquire and own all the real property necessary to render public services.

The Federal and State laws, within their respective jurisdictions, shall determine the instances in which occupation of private property shall be considered to be of public utility, and, in accordance with such laws, the administrative authorities shall issue the respective declaration. The price established as compensation for the expropriated property shall be based on the assessed value recorded in the assessment or tax offices, whether this value has been declared by the owner or tacitly accepted by him by having paid taxes on that basis. The increased or decreased value of such private property due to improvements or depreciation, which occurred after such assessment, is the only portion of the value that shall be subject to expert judgment and judicial proceedings. This same procedure shall be followed in the case of property the value of which is not recorded in the tax offices.

The exercise of actions pertaining to the Nation by virtue of the provisions of this article shall be made effective by judicial procedure; but during these proceedings and by order of the proper courts, which must render a decision within a maximum of one month, the administrative authorities shall proceed without delay to occupy, administer, auction, or sell the lands and waters in question and all their appurtenances, and in no case may the acts of such authorities be set aside until a final decision has been rendered.

VII.The juridical personality of the communal population centers (nÃºcleos de poblaciÃ³n ejidales y comunales) is recognized, and their property attached to the land used for human settlements as well as for productive activities is protected.

The law protects the integrity of the lands of indigenous groups.

The law, taking into consideration the respect for and strengthening of the community life of the agricultural corporations (ejidos) and communities shall safeguard the land for human settlement and regulate the usage of common lands, forests, and waters and the necessary measures to stimulate and elevate the standard of life of their inhabitants.

The law, while respecting the will of the owners of communal lands (ejidatarios) and the community members to adopt the conditions most suitable to them for the use of their productive resources, shall regulate the exercise of the rights of the peasant communities over the land and of each community member over his or her own tract of land. At the same time, it shall establish the procedures by which the peasant communities and their members may associate with each other, with the State, or with third parties, and cede the use of their lands, and, in the specific case of community members, convey their parcel rights among the individual members of the local community; at the same time, it shall establish the requisites and procedures by which the community assembly may grant its members ownership of their tracts of land or parcels. The right of preference established by law shall be respected in cases where parcels are transferred.

No member of a local community may own more than the equivalent of five percent (5%) of all communal lands of that community. In all cases, ownership of lands by individual community members must conform to the limits specified in section XV.

The general assembly is the supreme organ of the communal population center, with the organization and roles established by law. The commissioner of the communal lands and property, elected democratically according to the terms of the law, is the representative of the center and the person responsible for implementing the resolutions of the assembly.

The restitution of lands, forests, and waters to centers of population will take place consistent with the terms established by regulatory law.

VIII.The following are declared null and void:

a.All transfers of lands, waters, and mountainous lands belonging to villages, settlements, groups, or communities, made by the local political leaders (jefes politicos), state governors, or other local authorities in contravention to the provisions of the law of June 25, 1856, and other related laws and rulings;

c.All survey or demarcation of boundary proceedings, transfers, alienations, or auction sales brought about during the period of time referred to in the preceding subsection, by companies, judges, or other federal or state authorities entailing encroachments on or illegal occupation of the lands, waters, and hills, lands held in common, or other holdings belonging to centers of population.



The sole exception to the aforementioned nullification shall be the lands to which title has been granted in allotments made in conformity with the law of June 25, 1856, and held with proper title by persons in their own name for more than ten years, when their area does not exceed fifty hectares.

IX.The divisions or allotments of land among the inhabitants of a given center of population which, although apparently legitimate are not so due to an error or defect, may be voided at the request of three-fourths of the residents holding one-fourth of the lands in question or one-fourth of such residents holding three-fourths of the lands.

For the purposes of equivalence, one hectare of irrigated land shall be computed as two hectares of seasonal land, as four of prime grazing land, and as eight of woods, mountainous land, or arid pasturage lands.

Also to be considered as small properties are land areas not exceeding one hundred fifty (150) hectares of land used to raise cotton if irrigated; and three hundred (300) when used for the cultivation of bananas, sugar cane, coffee, henequen, rubber, coconuts, wine grapes, olives, quinine, vanilla, cacao, agave, prickly pear (nopal) or fruit trees.

Whenever, due to irrigation or drainage works or any other works executed by the owners or occupants of a small property, the quality of the land is improved, such property shall not be subject to agrarian appropriation even if, by virtue of the improvements made, the maximums indicated in this section are exceeded, provided that the requirements specified by law are met.

When within one small livestock raising property improvements are made to lands dedicated to agricultural uses, the area allocated for this purpose shall not exceed in any given case the limits referred to in the second and third paragraphs of this section pertaining to the quality that these lands had before such improvements.

XIX.On the basis of this Constitution, the State shall take measures for the expeditious and honest administration (imparticiÃ³n) of agrarian justice with the aim of guaranteeing juridical security of the tenancy and ownership of collective and communal lands and of small properties, and it will support the legal counseling of farmers.

All matters concerning the boundaries of communal and community lands, regardless of their origin, including pending or ongoing issues between two or more centers of population; as well as questions arising from the ownership of the land in communes and communities, shall be under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government.

Consequently, the law shall severely punish and the authorities shall effectively prosecute every concentration or gathering in one or a few hands of articles of prime necessity for the purpose of obtaining an increase in prices; every act or proceeding which prevents or tends to prevent free competition in production, industry or commerce, or services to the public; every agreement or combination, in whatever manner it may be made, of producers, industrialists, merchants, and common carriers, or those engaged in any other service, to prevent competition among themselves and to compel consumers to pay exaggerated prices; and in general, whatever constitutes an exclusive or undue advantage in favor of one or more specified persons and to the prejudice of the public in general or of any social class.


The law shall establish the basis to determine the maximum prices of articles, objects, or products considered to be essential to the national economy or popular consumption, as well as the rules applicable to the organization and distribution of those articles, objects, or products in order to preclude unnecessary or excessive interventions that may trigger shortage of supplies or increased prices. The law shall protect the consumers and shall promote their organization and the safeguarding of their best interests.

Its highest priority shall be to procure the stability of the national currency's buying power, as a way of strengthening the State's control of the national development. No authority may order the Bank to grant financing.


The functions that the State exclusively exercises through the Central Bank in the strategic areas relating to the coinage of money and the issuance of paper money do not constitute monopolies.

The direction of the Bank shall be carried out by persons appointed by the President of the Republic with the consent of the Chamber of Senators, or the Permanent Commission, as is the case; who will serve for periods of time and at intervals that promote the autonomous exercise of their functions; who may only be removed from their position for grave cause, and who may not hold any other employment, duty, or commission, with the exception of those in which they act in the Bank's representation and those of non-salaried positions in artistic, scientific, cultural, or charitable institutions. The persons in charge of directing the affairs of the Central Bank will be subject to political judgment in accordance with the provisions of Article 110 of this Constitution.


Associations of workers formed to protect their own interests do not constitute monopolies; nor do cooperative associations or societies of producers, which in defense of their interests or of the general interest sell directly in foreign markets the domestic or industrial products which are the main source of wealth in the region in which they are produced and which are not essential articles, provided that such associations are under the supervision and protection of the Federal or State Governments and that they were previously duly authorized for that purpose by the respective legislatures, in every case. The legislatures themselves or on proposal of the Executive may, when the public need so requires, revoke the authorizations granted for the formation of the associations in question.


Neither do the privileges that, for a specified period of time, are granted to authors and artists for the production of their works, nor those that, for the exclusive use of their inventions, may be granted to inventors and to those who improve a product constitute monopolies.


The State, subject to the laws, may in cases of general interest grant concession for the provision of public services, or the exploitation, use and development of goods in the domain of the Federation, except in the instances determined by laws. The laws will specify rules and conditions to ensure the efficiency of the provision of services and the social utilization of property and will prevent instances of concentration that are contrary to the public interest.


The governance of public services shall be in accord with the provisions of the Constitution and carried out only through the law.


Subsidies may be granted to essential activities when they are broad in scope and temporary in nature and do not substantially affect the finances of the Nation. The State shall oversee their application and evaluate their results.

SECOND TITLE

CHAPTER I. National Sovereignty and Form of Government
Share

Article 39
Share

The national sovereignty resides essentially and originally in the people. All public power emanates from the people and is instituted for their benefit. The people have, at all times, the inalienable right to alter or modify the form of their government.



Article 40
Share

It is the will of the Mexican people to be constituted in a representative, democratic, federal Republic composed of free and sovereign States in all that concerns their internal affairs but united in a Federation established according to the principles of this fundamental law.



Article 41
Share

The people exercise their sovereignty through the organs of the Union in those cases within its competence and through those of the States in all that relates to their internal affairs, under the respective terms established by the present Federal Constitution and the individual constitutions of the States, which shall in no event contravene the stipulations of the Federal Pact.


The periodic renewal (renovaciÃ³n) of the Legislative and Executive Powers will take place through free, authentic, and periodic elections in conformity with the following basic principles:

I.The political parties are entities of public interest; the law shall determine the rules and requirements for their legal registration and the specific forms of their intervention in the electoral process. The national political parties will have the right to participate in state and municipal elections as well as in those of the Federal District.

The objective of the political parties is to promote the participation of people in the democratic life, contribute to the integration of national representation and, as organizations of citizens, make possible their access to the exercise of public power, in accordance with the programs, principles, and ideas that they postulate and by means of universal, free, secret, and direct suffrage. Only citizens may form political parties and affiliate freely and individually with them; by contrast, the intervention of labor organizations or organizations with a different social objective in the creation of political parties and any form of corporate association remains prohibited.

The electoral authorities may intervene in the internal affairs of political parties in the terms defined by law.

II.The law shall guarantee that the national political parties dispose on an equitable basis of the means necessary to conduct their activities and shall provide rules for the financing of political parties and their electoral campaigns, ensuring that public resources prevail over those of private origin.

Public financing for political parties that maintain their registration after each election will consist of the amounts paid to sustain their ordinary activities, those needed to secure votes during the elections and those for specific purposes. It will be granted in accordance with the following principles and the provisions of the law:

a.Public financing to support their ordinary permanent activities shall be fixed annually, multiplying the total number of citizens registered as voters with sixty-five percent of the daily minimum wage in the Federal District. Thirty percent of the amount calculated as previously described shall be distributed among the political parties on an equal basis and the remaining seventy percent in accordance with the percentage of votes they have obtained in the preceding election of Deputies;

b.Public financing for the activities related to the competition for votes in the year in which the President of the Republic and the senators and federal deputies are elected shall be equivalent to fifty percent of the public financing to which each party is entitled for ordinary activities in that year; when only federal deputies are elected, it shall be equivalent to thirty percent of the aforementioned financing of ordinary activities;

c.Public financing for specific activities, concerning education, training, socio-economic and political research, as well as editorial tasks, shall amount to three percent of the total amount of public financing which is due each year for ordinary activities. Thirty percent of the amount calculated as previously described shall be distributed among the political parties on an equal basis and the remaining seventy percent in accordance with the percentage of votes they have obtained in the preceding election of Deputies.



The law shall set the criteria to determine limits for the political parties' expenditures in the internal candidate selection processes and in their electoral campaigns. The same law shall establish the maximum amount that their supporters may contribute, the total sum of which may in no party exceed ten percent of the spending limit set for the last presidential campaign; it shall also fix the procedures for the control and monitoring of the origin and use of all resources at their disposal and prescribe the sanctions which have to be imposed for non-compliance with these provisions.

In the same manner the law shall establish the procedure for the liquidation of the obligations of parties which lose their registration and the conditions in which their property and remaining assets are transferred to the Federation.

III.The political parties shall be entitled to permanent use of the communication media.



The Federal Electoral Institute shall be the sole authority to decide on the time which is allocated to the State for its own purposes and to the national political parties for the exercise of their rights, in accordance with the following provisions and the provisions of the law:

a.From the start of the primaries until election day the Federal Electoral Institute shall have forty-eight minutes daily which shall be split up in portions of two to three minutes in each hour of broadcasting in all radio and television channels, in accordance with the timetable referred to in paragraph c) of this section;

b.During the primaries the political parties shall be entitled jointly to one minute in each hour of broadcasting in all radio and television channels; the remaining time shall be used in accordance with the provisions of the law;

c.During the election campaigns at least eighty-five percent of the available time to which paragraph a) of this section refers must be used in order to allow the political parties to exercise their rights;

d.The broadcasts in all radio and television channels shall be spread over the program scheduled between six o'clock a.m. and midnight;

e.The time set aside for the political parties to exercise their rights shall be distributed among them in accordance with the following principles: thirty percent on an equal basis and the remaining seventy percent in accordance with the percentage of votes they have obtained in the preceding election of federal Deputies;

f.Each national political party without representation in the Congress of the Union shall receive only the amount of time in radio and television which corresponds to the percentage fixed on an equal basis as described in the preceding paragraph;

g.Regardless of the provisions in sections A and B of this basis and in the periods between primary and federal election campaigns, the Federal Electoral Institute shall be given up to twelve percent of the total time of the State in radio and television, in conformity with the law and in whatever form; of this total the Institute shall distribute fifty percent among the national political parties on an equal basis; it shall use the remaining time for its own purposes, or for those of other electoral authorities, federal as well as state authorities. Each national political party shall use the time which is assigned to it in accordance with this concept in a monthly broadcast of five minutes and the remaining time in messages of twenty seconds each. In all cases the broadcasts to which this paragraph is referring shall be made subject to the timetable which the Institute determines in conformity with paragraph d) of this Section. If this appears warranted by special circumstances, the Institute may use the time slots reserved for political messages of a political party.




The political parties may never, by themselves or through third persons, purchase or reserve any time in radio or television.


No other natural or juridical person may, for its own benefit or that of third parties, purchase advertising time in radio or television for the purpose of influencing the electoral preferences of the citizens, neither for nor against political parties or candidates for elective office. The broadcasting of such advertisements which are purchased abroad remains prohibited in the national territory.


The provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs must be implemented within the jurisdiction of the States and of the Federal District in conformity with the applicable legislation.




For electoral purposes in the federal entities the Federal Electoral Institute shall decide on the allocation of the time to which the State is entitled in radio and television in the broadcasting stations and channels covering the entity in question, in conformity with the following provisions and the provisions of the law:

a.In the case of local election processes in which the election dates coincide with federal election dates, the time assigned for each federal entity shall be included in the total time available in accordance with paragraphs a), b) and c) of this section;

b.In other election processes the allocation shall take place in the terms defined by law, in conformity with the criteria set out in this section of the Constitution, and

c.The Distribution of the time among the political parties, including those registered locally, shall take place in accordance with the criteria set out in section A of this basis and the provisions of the applicable legislation.




When in the opinion of the Federal Electoral Institute the total time in radio and television to which this and the preceding section refer is insufficient for its own purposes or that of other electoral authorities, it shall take the necessary measures in order to make up for the lack of time, in using the faculties which it has been granted by the law.




In their political and electoral propaganda the parties shall abstain from expressions which denigrate the institutions or the parties themselves, or slander people.


During the time of federal and local election campaigns and until the end of the respective election day the dissemination of any government propaganda of the federal, state or municipal authorities, organs of government of the Federal District, of its delegations or any other public entity must be suspended. The only exceptions shall be the information campaigns of the electoral authorities, those concerning education and health services, and those necessary for the protection of the civilian population in case of an emergency.




The infringements of the provisions of this basis shall be sanctioned by the Federal Electoral Institute by means of speedy remedies which may include the order to cancel immediately broadcasts in radio and television, licences and permissions which violate the law.


IV.The law shall establish the delays for the completion of the internal nomination and selection processes of candidates for elective office by the parties, as well as the rules governing the primaries and election campaigns.

The duration of the campaigns in the year in which the President of the Republic, the senators and the federal deputies are elected shall be ninety days; in the year in which only the federal deputies are elected, the campaigns shall last sixty days. In no case may the primaries take up more than two thirds of the time reserved for the election campaign.

The violation of these provisions by the parties or any other natural or juridical person shall be sanctioned in conformity with the law.

V.The organization of federal elections is a state function carried out by an autonomous public body known as the Federal Electoral Institute, which possesses legal personality and its own assets and whose members shall be chosen by the Legislative Branch of the Union, the national political parties and the citizens, in accordance with the terms established by law. Certainty, legality, independence, impartiality, and objectivity shall be the guiding principles in the exercise of this state function.

The Federal Electoral Institute shall be the authority in the [electoral] matter, independent in its decision-making and functioning and professional in the performance of its duties; its structure shall include directive, executive, technical and control organs. The General Council shall be its superior directive organ and shall be composed of a council president and eight electoral councilors, and additionally by council members from the Legislative Branch, representatives of the political parties, and an Executive Secretary who shall take part in the deliberations but not in the vote; the rules for the organization and operation of the council's organs as well as the chain of command amongst them shall be determined by law. The executive and technical organs shall have the qualified personnel necessary to offer professional electoral services. An Audit Office (ContralorÃ­a General) shall have the task of monitoring the revenue and the expenditure of the Institute, enjoying functional and managerial autonomy to this effect. The labor relations of the personnel working in this public organ shall be regulated by the provisions of the electoral law and by the Statute that the General Council enacts pursuant to it. The organs of control of the electoral register shall consist mostly of representatives of the national political parties. The directive boards (mesas directivas) in the polling places shall be composed of citizens.

The council president shall exercise his/her functions for six years and may be reelected only once.

As the case may be, the president and the other members shall be elected successively by a vote of two-thirds of the members present in the Chamber of Deputies upon proposal of the parliamentary parties, following an extended consultation of society. In the case of an absolute incapacity of the council president or any of the electoral councilors, a replacement shall be elected in order to serve for the rest of the term. The law shall establish the corresponding rules and procedures.

The council president and the electoral councilors may not hold any other employment, duty, or commission, with the exception of those in which they act in the General Council's representation, and those of non-remunerated positions in educational, scientific, cultural, research, or charitable institutions. The pay of the council president and the electoral councilors shall be equal to the one afforded to the ministers of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation.

The head of the Audit Office of the Institute shall be appointed by the Chamber of Deputies with the vote of two thirds of its members present upon proposal of the public institutions of higher education, in the form and the terms determined by law. He/she shall exercise his/her functions for six years and may be reelected only once. In administrative terms he/she shall be affiliated to the presidency of the General Council and shall maintain the necessary technical coordination with the Superior Financial Authority of the Federation.

The Executive Secretary shall be appointed by two-thirds of the General Council upon proposal by its president.

The law shall establish the requirements that the president of the General Council, the electoral councilors, the General Auditor and the Executive Secretary of the Federal Electoral Institute must satisfy for their appointment; persons which have discharged the functions of council president, electoral councilors and Executive Secretary may not assume functions in public bodies in whose election they have participated in the two years following their retirement.

The electoral councilors of the Legislative Branch shall be proposed by the parliamentary groups with party affiliation in either Chamber of the Congress. There shall only be one councilor for each parliamentary group regardless of his or her confirmation by both Chambers of the Congress of the Union.

The Federal Electoral Institute shall be responsible, in an absolute and direct form, and in addition to any other responsibilities determined by law, for the activities related to civic training and education, electoral geography, the rights and prerogatives of interest groups (agrupaciones) and political parties, voter registry and lists, the printing of electoral materials, the preparation for the election day, the counting of votes in accordance with the terms specified by law, the declaration of the validity of the election and the granting of election certificates of Deputies and Senators, the counting of votes in the election of the President of the United Mexican States in one-member electoral district, as well as the regulation of electoral monitoring and of opinion surveys or polls conducted for electoral purposes. The meetings of the directive organs of collective character (Ãrganos colegiados de direcciÃ³n) shall be public in accordance with the terms established by the law.

The auditing of the finances of the national political parties shall be the responsibility of a technical organ of the General Council of the Federal Electoral Institute, which shall enjoy managerial autonomy and whose head shall be appointed by a two-thirds vote of the Council upon proposal of its President. The law shall regulate the composition and functioning of the said organ in detail, as well as the procedures for the application of sanctions by the General Council. In the fulfillment of its duties the technical organ shall not be limited the banking, property or fiscal secrets.

The technical organ shall be the instrument through which the authorities competent for the control of party finances in the federal entities may overcome the limitations to which the preceding paragraph refers.

The Federal Electoral Institute shall assume, through agreement with the competent authorities of the federal authorities which so request, the organization of the local electoral processes in the terms established by the applicable legislation.

VI.To guarantee the principles of constitutionality and legality of the electoral acts and decisions, a complaints system shall be established in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution and the law. This system shall give finality to the distinct stages of electoral processes and guarantee the protection of the political rights of citizens to vote, be elected, and to associate in accordance with the terms of Article 99 of this Constitution.

a.A bill approved in the Chamber where it originated shall be referred to the other for discussions. If the latter approves it, it shall be sent to the Executive which, if it has observations to make, shall immediately publish it.

b.All bills shall be regarded as approved by the Executive Power if it is not returned with observations to the Chamber of its origin within ten business days; unless during this time the Congress shall have adjourned or suspended its sessions, in which case the return must be made on the first business day on which the Congress has reassembled.

c.A bill or proposed decree rejected in whole or in part by the Executive shall be returned with observations to the Chamber of origin. It must be discussed anew by the latter, and if it is passed by a vote of two-thirds of the total membership, it shall again be sent to the other Chamber for review. If it is sanctioned there by the same two-thirds majority, the bill shall become law or decree and shall be returned to the Executive for its promulgation.

The voting on a law or decree shall be by roll call (nominales).

e.If a bill or proposed decree is rejected in part, amended, or added to by the reviewing Chamber, the new discussion in the Chamber of origin shall be limited to the part rejected or to the amendments or additions without modifying in any manner the approved articles. If the additions or amendments made by the reviewing Chamber are approved by an absolute majority  of the votes present in the Chamber of origin, the entire bill shall be sent to the Executive for the purposes indicated in section (a). If the additions or amendments proposed by the reviewing Chamber are rejected by a majority of the votes in the Chamber of origin, they shall be returned to the former for consideration of the views of the latter, and if the amendments or additions are rejected during this second revision by an absolute majority of the votes present, the bill, insofar as it has been approved by both Chambers, shall be sent to the Executive for the purposes indicated in section (a). If the reviewing Chamber insists, by an absolute majority of the votes present, upon such amendments and additions, the entire bill shall not be introduced until the following period of sessions unless both Chambers agree, by an absolute majority of their members present, that the law or decree be enacted only with the approved articles, and those added or amended shall be reserved for their scrutiny and vote at the following sessions.

f.In the interpretation, amendment, or abrogation of laws or decrees, the same procedure shall be followed as that established for their enactment:

g.All bills or proposed decrees that are rejected in the Chamber of their origin may not be introduced again in the sessions of that year.

h.The enactment of laws or decrees may commence in either of the two Chambers with the exception of bills pertaining to loans, taxes, or the recruiting of troops, all of which must be discussed first in the Chamber of Deputies.

j.The Executive of the Union may not offer observations to the resolutions of the Congress or of either Chamber when they exercise functions of an electoral body or of a jury or when the Chamber of Deputies declares that a senior official of the Federation must be impeached for official crimes.

Article 107
Share

All controversies referred to in Article 103 shall be subject to procedures and forms of the juridical order determined by law, in accordance with the following bases:

I.A trial for judicial relief (amparo) shall always be held at the instance of the injured party.

II.The judgment shall always be such that it affects only private individuals, being limited to affording them redress and protection in the particular case to which the complaint refers without making any general declaration as to the law or act on which the complaint is based.

Judicial relief trials must resolve the complaints in accordance with the provisions of the Regulatory Law of Articles 103 and 107 of this Constitution.

In cases where members of an ejido or communal holders having a de facto or de jure communal status contest acts that resulted or could result in depriving them of ownership or possession and enjoyment of their lands, waters, pastures, and hills; all the evidence that can benefit the mentioned entities and individuals shall be collected, and the steps necessary and required to ensure the claimants' rights, shall be taken.

The cases referred to in the preceding paragraph shall not be dismissed for lack of procedural activity or expiry, at any level. When actions that affect the collective rights of concentrations of population are challenged, such challenges cannot be dismissed nor the actions consented to unless, in the first instance, they are agreed to by the General Assembly or the consent emanates from the latter.

III.Relief (amparo) from judicial, administrative, or labor court rulings shall be granted only:

a.Against final judgments or awards and resolutions, which bring the trial to an end, against which no ordinary recourse is available by virtue of which these judgments can be modified or amended, where the violation of the law is committed in the judgments or awards, or whether, if committed during the course of the trial, the violation prejudices the petitioner's defense to the extent of affecting the judgment; provided that in civil matters timely objection and protest were made against it because of refusal to certify the wrong and that if the violation was committed in first instance, it was urged in second instance as a grievance. These requisites will not be necessary in judicial relief proceedings against judgments that pertain to marital status or that affect the order and stability of the family;

b.Against acts at the trial, the execution of which would be irreparable out of court, or at the conclusion of the trial once all available recourses have been exhausted, and

c.Against acts that affect persons who are strangers to the trial.



IV.In administrative matters, cases of judicial relief may be invoked against decisions that cause an injury that cannot be remedied through any legal recourse, trial, or defense. It shall not be necessary to exhaust these remedies when the law that established them, in authorizing the suspension of the contested act, demands greater requirements than the regulatory law for trials in such cases requires as a condition for ordering such suspension.

V.Relief against final judgments or awards and resolutions that effectively conclude a trial, based on violations committed during the course of the trial or at the time the judgment was made, will be considered before the corresponding Collegiate Circuit Tribunal, in accordance with the distribution of competences established in the Organic Law of the Judicial Power of the Federation, in the following cases:

a.In criminal matters, against final rulings given by judicial courts, whether they are federal, of the common order, or military;

b.In administrative matters, when private individuals challenge the final decisions or judgments of administrative or judicial courts that bring a trial to an end, and there is no other ordinary recourse or legal remedy available;

c.In civil matters, when they are final judgments decreed in proceedings of federal order or in mercantile proceedings, regardless of whether the ruling authority is federal or local, or in proceedings of the common order;

The judgments in federal civil trials can be challenged in a case of judicial relief (amparo) by any of the parties, including the Federation, in defense of their patrimonial interests, and

d.In labor matters, for awards made by the federal or local boards of conciliation and arbitration or by the federal conciliation and arbitration tribunal of workers in service to the State.



The Supreme Court of Justice, on its own initiative or upon founded petition made by the corresponding Collegiate Circuit Courts or the Attorney General of Republic, may hear cases of direct judicial relief (amparo), when their interest and implications so merit.

VI.In the cases referred to in the preceding section, the regulatory law of Articles 103 and 107 of this Constitution shall specify the procedure and terms to be followed by the Collegiate Circuit Courts, and, as may be the case, the Supreme Court of Justice, in issuing their respective resolutions.

VII.When a writ of relief (amparo) against acts at the trial, outside the trial, or after its conclusion, or if persons foreign to the case are affected, against laws or against acts of administrative authorities, application shall be made to the district judge in whose jurisdiction is located the place in which the act in question was performed or was to be performed, and the procedure shall be limited to the report from the authority in question, to a hearing for which a single summons will include the order for submission of the report and for evidence to be presented by the interested parties and their allegations, the judgment to be rendered at this same hearing.

VIII.Judgments of District judges or Unitary Circuit Courts in cases of relief (amparo) shall be subject to review. The Supreme Court of Justice will review such judgments in the following instances:

a.When the petition for relief has been challenged because it directly violates this Constitution, federal, state, or local laws, international treaties, regulations enacted by the President of the Republic in accordance with section I of Article 89 of this Constitution, and regulations of state and local law made by the governors of the States or by the Head of the Federal District where constitutional challenge remains;

b.In any of the cases included in sections II and III of Article 103 of this Constitution.



The Supreme Court of Justice, on its own initiative or upon a founded petition made by the corresponding Collegiate Circuit Tribunal or the Attorney General of Republic, may hear cases of direct judicial relief (amparo) when their interest and implications so merit.

In the instances not referred to in the previous paragraphs, the cases of relief (amparo) will be brought before the Collegiate Circuit Courts, and there shall be no recourse admitted against their judgments;

IX.The decisions in cases of judicial relief (amparo) pronounced by a Collegiate Circuit Court may not be appealed unless the decision involves the constitutionality of a law or establishes a direct interpretation of a Constitutional provision, the resolution of which, in the judgment of the Supreme Court and in accordance with the general principles of law, involves the determination of an important and transcendental matter. Cases may only be appealed to the Supreme Court of Justice only in these instances, and such appeal shall be limited exclusively to the resolution of the actual constitutional questions.

X.The contested acts may be subject to suspension in those cases and under conditions and guarantees specified by law, with respect to which account shall be taken of the nature of the alleged violation, the difficulty of remedying the damages that might be suffered by the injured party by its performance, and damages that the suspension might cause to third parties and the public interest.

Such suspension must be granted with respect to final judgments in criminal matters at the time notice is given of the application for a writ of relief (amparo), and in civil matters when bond is posted by the plaintiff to cover liability for damages resulting from the suspension, but this is waived if the other party also pays bond to ensure the restoration of things as they were if relief is granted and to pay resulting damages.

XI.The suspension shall be requested from the responsible authority, in the case of direct relief (amparo) before the Collegiate Circuit Courts, and the appropriate authority shall issue a decision in the matter. In all cases, the aggrieved party must present the petition for relief before the proper responsible authority, accompanied by copies of the petition for the other parties in the case, including the Public Ministry, and one for the judicial files. In other cases, the petition for suspension shall be brought before and resolved by the district judges or the Unitary Circuit Courts.

XII.Violations of the guarantees set forth in Article 16, in criminal matters, and Articles 19 and 20, may be taken before the superior body of court that committed them, or before the appropriate District judge or Unitary Circuit Tribunal, and in either case the decision shall be rendered in accordance with the terms prescribed in section VIII.

If the District judge or Unitary Circuit Tribunal does not reside in the same place where the responsible authority resides, the law shall specify the judge before whom the writ of relief must be presented, and that judge may provisionally suspend the act in question, in those cases and under the terms established in the same law.

XIII.If the Collegiate Circuit Courts render contradictory opinions in relief (amparo) cases within their competence, the ministers of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Attorney General of the Republic, the aforementioned courts, or the parties that intervened in the case where the challenged opinion was rendered, may denounce such contradiction before the appropriate section, to decide which opinion shall prevail as jurisprudence.

When the Chambers of the Supreme Court of Justice sustain contradictory opinions in relief (amparo) cases within their competence, any one Chamber or the Attorney General of the Republic, or any of the parties who intervened in the cases in which these opinions were sustained, may denounce the contradiction before the Supreme Court of Justice, which, functioning in Plenary, shall decide which opinion shall prevail.

Both in this instance and in the case provided for in the preceding paragraph, the decision rendered by the sections or the Supreme Court as a whole shall be solely for the effect of setting the precedent and shall not affect the concrete judicial situation deriving from contradictory judgments in the case in which they were rendered.

XIV.Except as provided in the last paragraph of section II of this article, the case of relief will be dismissed or declared to have expired because of inactivity by the plaintiff or the appellant, respectively, when the act appealed was of civil or administrative order, in those cases and according to the terms specified by the regulatory law. The dismissal of the case for inactivity shall have the effect of making the appealed judgment final.

XV.The Attorney General of the Republic or an agent of the Federal Public Ministry designated for the purpose shall be a party in all proceedings of relief (amparo) but may abstain from intervening in such cases if the matter in question lacks, in his judgment, public interest.

XVI.If, after relief (amparo) has been granted, the responsible authority insists on the repetition of the contested act or attempts to evade the decision of the federal authority, and the Supreme Court of Justice deems that the noncompliance is inexcusable, he shall be immediately removed from office and brought before the appropriate District judge. If it was excusable, with a prior declaration of noncompliance or repetition, the Supreme Court will provide sufficient time for the official to comply with the judgment. If the authority does not comply with the judgment within the time granted, the Supreme Court of Justice shall proceed in accordance with the terms originally specified.

When the nature of the act permits, the Supreme Court of Justice, once it has determined the noncompliance or repetition, may decide on its own to require compliance with the judgments of relief (amparo) when noncompliance seriously affects society or third parties in a greater proportion than the economic benefits that the plaintiff could obtain. Equally, the plaintiff may request the appropriate organ to force compliance with the judgment of relief, as long as the nature of the act allows it.

Procedural inactivity or the lack of advancement by the interested party in cases to enforce the judgments on relief (amparo) shall result in its expiry in accordance with the terms of the regulatory law.

XVII.The responsible authority shall be taken before the appropriate authority whenever he fails to suspend the appealed act when bound to do so, and when he posts bond that is illusory or insufficient, and in such cases the responsible authority and bondsman are jointly and severally liable, and

XVIII.(Abrogated).

During his term of office the President of the Republic may be impeached only for treason to the country and serious common law crimes.


The State governors, deputies of the local legislatures, and magistrates of Superior Tribunals of Local Justice, and, as the case may be, the members of Councils of the Local Judiciaries shall be liable for violations of this Constitution and the federal laws as well as for the improper administration of federal funds and resources.


The constitutions of the States of the Republic shall confer, in the same terms as the first paragraph of this Article and consistent with their responsibilities, the status of public officials to those persons who hold employment, duties, or commissions in the States and the municipalities.



Article 109
Share

The Congress of the Union and the Legislatures of the States, within the scope of their respective competences, shall enact laws establishing the responsibilities of public officials and any other norms for which they may be held accountable, specifying their liabilities, in accordance with the following considerations:

I.They shall impose, through a political trial, the sanctions indicated in Article 110 on the public officials designated therein, when in the exercise of their functions such servants have committed acts or omissions to the detriment of the fundamental public interest, or to their own best interest.

A political trial cannot take place for the mere expression of ideas.

II.The commission of crimes by any public official shall be prosecuted and punished in accordance with the terms of the applicable criminal laws, and

III.Administrative sanctions will be applied to public servants for acts and omissions that affect the legality, honor, loyalty, impartiality, and efficiency that must be observed in the discharge of their employment, duties, or commissions.

The procedures for the application of the aforementioned sanctions shall be developed autonomously. Sanctions of the same nature may not be imposed twice for a single act.

The laws shall determine the instances and circumstances under which public officials may be criminally penalized for illicit enrichment while holding their offices, for themselves or for any other person, when they substantially increase their wealth, acquire goods, or utilize goods as if they were their owners, when there is no legal justification to do so. The criminal laws shall include the penalties of confiscation and seizure of these goods besides any other sanctions it deems appropriate.




Any citizen, under his/her most strict responsibility and through the presentation of evidence, may formulate an accusation before the Chamber of Deputies of the Congress of the Union with respect to the conduct referred to in this article.



Article 110
Share

The following may be subject to political trial: the Senators and Deputies of the Congress of the Union, the Ministers of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, the Members of the Council of the Federal Judiciary, the Secretaries of State (Secretarios de Despacho), the Representatives of the Assembly of the Federal District, the Head of Government of the Federal District, the Attorney General of the Republic, the Attorney General of Justice of the Federal District, Circuit Magistrates and District Judges, the Magistrates and Judges of Common Law (Fuero ComÃºn) of the Federal District; the Members of the Council of the Judiciary of the Federal District; the Council President, council members and the executive secretary of the Federal Electoral Institute, the magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal, the Directors General or their equivalents of decentralized bodies, enterprises with majority state participation, societies and associations associated with these, and public trusts.


The State governors, local deputies, magistrates of local Superior Tribunals of Justice, and, in their case, the members of the councils of state judiciaries, may be subject to political trial under the terms of this title only for serious violations of this Constitution and the federal laws that emanate from it, as well as for the improper administration of federal funds and resources, but in this case, the ruling shall be only declarative, and it shall be communicated to the state legislatures so that, in the exercise of their powers, they may proceed accordingly.


The sanctions shall consist of the dismissal of the public official, who from that point shall be unable to hold any position, employment, duty, or commission of any nature in the public service.


For the application of the sanctions referred to above, the Chamber of Deputies shall remit the respective accusation to the Chamber of Senators, such declaration having been made by the majority of the members present in the session of the Chamber of Deputies, and after having concluded the proceeding and hearing the accused.


Cognizant of the accusation, the Chamber of Senators constituted as a grand jury shall impose the appropriate penalty by resolution of two-thirds of the members present in session, with the appropriate diligence and after hearing the accused.


The declarations and resolutions of the Chambers of Deputies and the Senators are unchallengeable (inatacables).

If the Chamber's resolution is negative, all further proceedings shall be suspended, but that shall not constitute an obstacle for the accused to be charged with such crime after he or she has left office, for this decision does not, in any way, prejudge the merits of the accusation (imputaciÃ³n).


If the Chamber declares that there are grounds to proceed, the subject shall be at the disposal (disposiciÃ³n) of the competent authorities, which shall then proceed in accordance with the law.


Regarding the President of the Republic, the accusation shall only be brought before the Chamber of Senators in accordance with the terms of Article 110. In this instance, the Chamber of Senators shall reach a decision based on the applicable penal legislation.


To be able to proceed penalty against the State governors, local deputies, magistrates of the Superior Tribunals of Justice of the States, and, as may be the case, members of the local councils of the judiciary, for federal crimes, the same procedures previously established in this article shall be followed, but, in these cases, the declaration of justification will have the effect of communicating to the state legislatures that by exercising their power they may proceed as appropriate.


The declarations and resolutions of the Chambers of Deputies and the Senators are unchallengeable.


The effect of the declaration that gives grounds to proceed against the accused shall be loss of office and shall make him subject to a criminal process. If the accused is acquitted, he may resume his office. However, if he is found guilty of a crime committed during the exercise of the office, the defendant (indulto) shall not be granted a pardon.


A declaration of justification (procedencia) shall not be required in proceedings of the civil order that are brought against any public official.

These penalties shall consist, in addition to those provided by law, of suspension, dismissal, and disqualification, as well as economic sanctions, and must be set in proportion to the economic benefits obtained by the responsible and with the economic damages caused by his acts or omissions as referred to by section III of Article 109, but they may not exceed three times the benefits obtained or the damages and injuries caused.


The responsibility of the State for damages caused to the property or rights of private individuals resulting from irregular administrative activities shall be objective and direct. The individuals shall have the right to an indemnification in accordance with the bases, limits, and procedures established by law.



Article 114
Share

The political trial procedure may be initiated only during the period in which the public official is in office and within a year afterwards. The corresponding sanctions shall be applied within a period no greater than a year after the procedure is initiated.

The law shall specify the cases of prescription of administrative responsibility, taking into account the nature and consequences of the acts and omissions as referred to in section III of Article 109.

FIFTH TITLE. States of the Federation and the Federal District
Share

Article 115
Share

The States shall adopt, for their internal government (rÃ©gimen), the republican, representative, and popular form of government (gobierno), with the "Free Municipality" (Municipio Libre) as the basis of their territorial division and political and administrative organization, in accordance with the following principles:

I.Each Municipality shall be governed (gobernado) by a council (ayuntamiento) elected by direct popular vote and constituted by a Municipal President and the number of aldermen (regidores) and councilors (sÃ­ndicos) determined by law. The competence granted by this Constitution to the municipal government shall be exercised in an exclusive manner, and there shall be no intermediate authority between it and the government of the State.

Municipal presidents, aldermen and members of the councils, chosen by direct popular election, may not be reelected for the term immediately following. Persons who discharge the functions of those offices either by indirect election, appointment or designation by any authority, no matter what title they may be given, likewise may not be reelected for the term immediately following. None of the aforementioned officials, when [actually] holding office, may be elected for the term immediately following as alternates, but persons designated as alternates may be elected as office holders the term immediately following unless they have performed such duties during the preceding term.

The local legislatures, with the consent of two-thirds of their members, may suspend the councils, declare their dissolution, and suspend or revoke the office of any of their members for any of the serious causes that the local law provides (prevenga), as long as their members have had sufficient opportunity to submit the evidence and make the arguments that in their judgment they believe to be opportune.

Members leaving office shall be substituted by their alternates or according to the provisions of the law.

In cases where a council has been declared dissolved or when, because of the resignation or absence of the majority of its members and where, conforming to the law, it is not appropriate for the alternates to enter into their functions and there are no new elections, the State legislatures shall appoint people to the municipal councils from within the community to conclude the respective terms. These councils shall consist of the number of members determined by law, and they shall comply with the same eligibility requirements as established for the aldermen.

II.Municipalities shall be vested with juridical personality and shall administer their assets in accordance with the law.

The councils shall be empowered to approve, in accordance with the laws on municipal matters enacted by the state legislatures, the orders of police and government, and the regulations, circulars and administrative provision of general observance within their respective jurisdictions, that organize the public municipal administration, regulate the matters, procedures, functions, and public services of their competence and ensure citizen and community participation.

The purpose of the laws referred to in the preceding paragraph is to establish:

a.The general bases of public municipal administration and administrative organs to settle the controversies which may arise between the administration and private parties, subject to the principles of equality, public notice, hearing, and legality;

b.The cases in which the agreement of two-thirds of the members of the councils shall be required to make resolutions affecting the municipal real-estate or acts or contracts that will either compromise municipal property or commit the municipality for a longer period than that of the council's term;

c.The general standard procedures to subscribe the types of contracts referred to in sections III and IV of this article, as well as the second paragraph of Article 116 of this Constitution;

d.The procedure and conditions for the state government to assume a municipal function or service, when, in the absence of the corresponding compact, the state legislature may consider that it is impossible for the municipality to exercise the function or perform the service; in these instances, previous request of the respective council shall be necessary, to be approved by a vote of two-thirds of its members, and

e.The provisions applicable to those municipalities lacking edicts or corresponding regulations.



The state legislatures shall issue the norms for the settlement of any disputes which may arise between municipalities and the state government, or among themselves, resulting from acts derived from clauses c) and d) above.

III.The municipalities shall be responsible for the following functions and public services:

a.Drinking water, drainage, sewage, and treatment of their waste water;

b.Public lighting;

c.Cleaning, collection, transfer, treatment, and final disposal of waste;

d.Markets and supply centers;

e.Cemeteries;

f.Public walkways;

g.Streets, parks, and gardens, and their maintenance;

h.Public security, in accordance with the terms of Article 21 of this Constitution, municipal preventive policing, transit; and

i.Conclude compacts for the administration and custody of federal zones.



Without prejudice to their constitutional competences, in the discharge of functions or providing services that are their responsibility, municipalities must observe (observarÃ¡n) provisions of federal and state laws.

The Municipalities, subject to a previous agreement among their councils, may coordinate and associate with each other in order to provide public services more efficiently or to ensure the most professional exercise of the functions that correspond to them. In this case and when the association involves municipalities of two or more States, the prior consent of the legislatures of the respective States shall be required. At the same time, when the respective council deems it necessary, they may conclude compacts with the State, so that the latter may either directly or through the corresponding organ temporarily assume the administration of some of them, or in coordination by both the State and the municipality.

The indigenous communities within the municipal ambit may coordinate and associate with one another under the terms and for the purpose provided by law.

IV.The Municipalities shall freely administer their finances, which shall include any profits obtained from property owned by them, as well the taxes and other revenue that the legislatures establish in their favor, and in any case:

a.They shall collect taxes, including additional taxes, which the States establish for real property, and its fractioning, division, consolidation, transfer, and improvement, as well as for any other things which change the value of real property;

The Municipalities may make compacts with their States so that the latter may assume some of the responsibilities related to the administration of the aforementioned contributions.

b.The federal participations, which shall be covered by the Federation for the municipalities in accordance with the bases, amounts, and terms which are determined annually by the legislatures of the States;

c.They collect revenue derived from the provision of public services in their charge.



Federal laws shall not limit the power of the States to establish the taxes referred to in clauses a) and c), and they shall not grant any exemptions to them. State laws shall not establish exemptions or subsidies with respect to the mentioned contributions in favor of any person or institution. Only the goods of the public domain of the Federation, the States, or of municipalities will be exempt from these taxes, except when these goods are used by state entities or private parties, under any title, for administrative ends, or objectives distinct from the public end.

The councils, within the ambit of their competence, shall propose to the state legislatures the fees and tariffs applicable to taxes, licenses, building permits, and the tables of per-unit values of land and construction which serve as the base for the collection of taxes on real property.

The State legislatures shall pass laws establishing the income laws of the municipalities and shall review and scrutinize their public accounts. The budgets of expenditures shall be approved by the council on the basis of their disposable income.

The resources constituting the municipal finances shall be managed directly by the councils or by whomever they shall authorize in accordance with the law.

V.The Municipalities, in accordance with the terms of the relevant State and federal laws, shall be empowered to:

a.Formulate, approve, and administer zoning and other plans of municipal urban development;

b.Participate in the creation and administration of their territorial reserves;

c.Participate in the formulation of regional development plans, which must be consistent with the general plans on the matter. When the Federation or the States develop projects of regional development, they must ensure the participation of municipalities;

In conducting these, and in accordance with the objectives set forth in the third paragraph of Article 27 of this Constitution, they shall enact the regulations and administrative provisions that are deemed to be necessary.

VI.When two or more urban centers located within the municipal territories of two or more federal entities form or tend to form a continuous demographic area, the Federation, the federal entities, and the respective municipalities, within the ambit of their competences, shall plan and regulate the development of these centers in a joint and coordinated manner, following the relevant federal law.

VII.The municipal preventive police shall be headed by the municipal president, in accordance with the terms of the corresponding regulation. The police shall follow the orders of the governor of the State, but only in cases of force majeure or when there is a serious disturbance of the public order.

The Federal Executive shall be in command of the public forces in the locations where he usually or temporarily resides.

VIII.The laws of the States shall introduce the principle of proportional representation in the election of all the municipal councils.

The labor relations between municipalities and their workers shall be regulated by the laws enacted by the State legislatures on the basis of provisions of Article 123 of this Constitution and their regulatory provisions.

The general minimum wages must be sufficient to satisfy the normal material, social, and cultural needs of the head of a family and to provide for the compulsory education of his children. The occupational minimum wage shall be set by also taking into consideration the conditions of different economic activities.

The minimum wages shall be set by a national commission consisting of representatives of the workers, employers, and the government, which may be assisted by the special consulting commissions that are considered indispensable for the best discharge of their functions.

This provision shall not be applicable in the case of actions covered in the following section. If the refusal is made by the workers, the labor contract shall be considered terminated.

The law shall determine those cases in which the employer may be exempted from the obligation of fulfilling the contract by payment of an indemnification. The employer shall also have the obligation to indemnify a worker in the amount of three months' wages when the worker leaves his employment due to lack of honesty on the part of the employer; or when the worker or his spouse, children, parents, or siblings have been mistreated by the employer. An employer may not relieve himself of this responsibility when said mistreatment is attributable to his subordinates or members of his family acting with his consent or tolerance.
